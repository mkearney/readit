```{r}
x <- "https://www.espn.com/nfl/scoreboard"
bm_html <- bench::mark(
  httr = httr::content(httr::GET(x), as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8"),
  xml2 = xml2::read_html(x),
  readthat = readthat(x),
  readLines = readLines(x, warn = FALSE),
  readr = readr::read_lines(x),
  check = FALSE,
  iterations = 10
)
