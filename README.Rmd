Quickly read text/source from local files and web pages.

## Installation

You can install the development released version of readthat from Github with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mkearney/readthat")
```

## Examples

Let's say we want to read-in the source of the following websites:

```{r}
## a vector of URLs
urls <- c(
  "https://mikewk.com",
  "https://cnn.com",
  "https://www.cnn.com/us"
)
```

Use `readthat()` to read or `downloadthat()` to download the text/source of a single file/URL

```{r}
## read single web/file (returns text vector)
x <- readthat(urls[1])

## download single web/file (returns path to downloaded file)
downloadthat(urls[1], "/tmp/mikewk.html")
```

Use `readthose()` to read or `downloadthose()` to download the texts/sources of multiple files/URLs

```{r}
## read multiple URLs/files (returns text vectorâ€“a string for each input)
x <- readthose(urls)

## download multiple URLs/files (returns paths to downloaded files)
downloadthose(urls, 
  c("/tmp/mikewk.html", "/tmp/cnn.html", "/tmp/cnnworld.html"))
```


## Comparisons

Benchmark comparison for reading a text file:

```{r}
x <- "~/Dropbox/data.txt"
bm_file <- bench::mark(
  readtext = readtext::readtext(x),
  readr = readr::read_lines(x),
  readthat = readthat(x),
  readLines = readLines(x),
  check = FALSE
)
bm_file
```

Benchmark comparison for reading a web page:

```{r}
x <- "https://www.espn.com/nfl/scoreboard"
bm_html <- bench::mark(
  httr = httr::content(httr::GET(x), as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8"),
  xml2 = xml2::read_html(x),
  readthat = readthat(x),
  readLines = readLines(x, warn = FALSE),
  readr = readr::read_lines(x),
  check = FALSE,
  iterations = 10,
  filter_gc = TRUE
)
bm_html
```
